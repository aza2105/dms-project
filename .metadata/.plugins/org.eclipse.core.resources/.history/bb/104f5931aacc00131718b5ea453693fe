At about 1040hrs on 5 April 2001, I met with Ms. Vanessa Kahn at 61 Southside Drive 
regarding  a  vehicle theft. Ms.  Kahn said she  parked  her  car  by  a  parking meter 
outside Southside Shopping Centre at about 0945 hours and went into a nearby shop 
to return a faulty torch she had purchased the previous day. She said that when she 
returned to the  leisure  centre  at  about  1000  hours, she  discovered  her  car was 
missing.
