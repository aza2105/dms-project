Will and Guy bring you the story behind the pigeon story. Zhang Liang, apologized for his 'bad behavior' when he forged a picture of pigeons receiving bird flu vaccine shots from medical workers. Amazingly this picture won first prize in the 2005 China International Press Photo Contest.  'I would like to apologize to the public,' said Liang, who was dismissed from Harbin daily. He copied the pigeon in the top right corner of his photo and pasted it in the top left corner.'I did it to make the photo perfect,' Zhang was quoted as saying. 'It was the first time for me to perfect pictures with computer technology and I did it only once.'
